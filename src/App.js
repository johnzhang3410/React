//we filter the tasks array. id is the task id that we want to delete, and task.id is the same thing. Since they are always the same, they won't pass the function. 
//When new array is created by filter()ï¼Œ the elements that we want to delete won't exist anymore.
//If every element's id is not the same as the id being passed in (the id of the task that we are trying to delete)
//return tasks that has a different id from the task id being passed in (the id that we are trying to delete) Unselected tasks gets to stay in the filtered array

//Toggle Reminder

//For every element in the tasks array, if the element id is the same as the id being passed in, it means we want to toggle that particular task, therefore we 
//set reminder to whatever opposite of task.reminder has
//if nothing is passed in (no doubleClick), just display task normally
